# SFT Mk 4 - FreeCAD Project
This is a FreeCAD project to model the Switched Flux Transmission device invented by Prajna Pranab.

![SFT-Mk4 better render](https://github.com/prajna-pranab/sft/assets/4018272/44b408cd-f7ac-476f-b79c-e943840d4240)

*(sorry about the lack of background and dropped rotor, I'll replace this pic when I can get a new render done)*

The model is organised as an Assembly 4 project and the assembly is contained in asm_SFT-Mk4.FCStd. To work with the complete assembly you will need to install the Assembly 4 Workbench, the Fasteners Workbench and, for rendering, the Render Workbench addons via the FreeCAD Addons Manager.
