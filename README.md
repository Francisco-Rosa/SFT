This is a FreeCAD project to model the Switched Flux Transmission device invented by Prajna Pranab.

The model is organised as an Assembly 4 project and the assembly is contained in SFT-Mk4.FCStd. To work with the complete assembly you will need to install the Assembly 4 Workbench, the Fasteners Workbench and, for rendering, the Render Workbench addons via the FreeCAD Addons Manager.
